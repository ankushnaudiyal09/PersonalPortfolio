This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. Built with React.js, it showcases my skills and projects in a dynamic and interactive way. I utilized Tailwind CSS for styling, improving my proficiency with its utility-first approach. GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is integrated to provide smooth, engaging animations, enhancing the overall user experience. This project was instrumental in solidifying my React coding and Tailwind CSS skills.
